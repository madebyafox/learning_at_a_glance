            <p>Welcome! And thank you for participating in our study. </p>

<p>The purpose of this research is to explore different types of user input for a computer based learning task. </p>

<p>You are going to complete four short learning exercises.  Each one involves looking at a page of pictures, and learning the names of the items depicted.  You can take as long as you need to learn all of the names on a page.  When you think you have learned all the names, you will press the ENTER key to continue.  Then we will test your memory, by repeating the names of each item, and asking you to choose the correct picture.  </p>

<p>In two of the exercises, you will navigate by using the mouse.  In the other two exercises, you will navigate by using your eyes. There is an eye tracker connected to the computer, which will monitor where you look on the screen.Before each exercise, we will tell you which input method you will use.  </p>


<p>Now here are few things to keep in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li> There are four exercises to complete. </li>
<li>Before each exercise, we will tell you whether you will navigate with the mouse, or with your gaze
<li>You can take as much time as you need to completely learn all of the pictures in each exercise. 
<li>You will press the enter key to move from the learning to the testing task.  
<li>Most importantly... 
In order for the eye tracker to work correctly, it is VERY IMPORTANT that you try not to move your head while completing the exercises.</ol> 

<p style="color:red;">If you are ready to continue, let the experimenter know, and we will calibrate the eye tracker to begin.  </p>
